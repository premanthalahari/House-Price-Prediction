# üè† House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

Predict house prices using machine learning and deploy your model with Streamlit! This project walks you through building a robust house price prediction system, from data preprocessing to deploying a user-friendly web application.

## üìå Project Overview
This project leverages the [Kaggle House Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) to build a machine learning model for predicting residential home prices. The deployed Streamlit app allows users to input features and get instant price predictions.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize trends, correlations, and outliers.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.
- **Model Training:** Test algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and **XGBoost** (best-performing model).
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics include MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R¬≤ score.
- **Streamlit Deployment:** Interactive web interface for real-time predictions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction

 2. **Install dependencies:**    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

 üöÄ Usage 
1. Run the Streamlit app locally:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

2. Access the app at http://localhost:8501 and input features to predict house prices.

üìä Dataset


The dataset contains 79 features describing residential homes in Ames, Iowa. Key steps include:


Handling missing data (e.g., LotFrontage, GarageYrBlt).


Encoding categorical variables (e.g., MSZoning, Neighborhood).


Feature engineering (e.g., creating TotalSF from 1stFlrSF + 2ndFlrSF).


Download the dataset from Kaggle.
